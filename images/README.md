# Pipeline Screenshots and Visualizations

This directory contains screenshots and visualizations demonstrating the ViToxReduce pipeline in action.

## Current Images

- `architecture_diagram.png` - Visual diagram of the 3-tier pipeline architecture
- `example_flow.png` - Example showing how the pipeline processes a toxic sentence
- `performance_comparison.png` - Performance metrics comparison with baseline methods
- `pipeline_screenshot.png` - Screenshot of the pipeline execution (if available)

## Adding More Images

You can add more screenshots and visualizations here, such as:

- Pipeline execution screenshots
- Performance comparison charts
- Example outputs showing before/after text
- Architecture diagrams
- Evaluation metrics visualizations

## Usage in Documentation

Images in this directory can be referenced in the main README.md using:

```markdown
![Pipeline Screenshot](images/pipeline_screenshot.png)
```

## Image Guidelines

- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `pipeline_execution.png`, `performance_chart.png`)
- Recommended formats: PNG (for screenshots), SVG (for diagrams)
- Keep file sizes reasonable for GitHub (prefer < 1MB per image)
- Use high resolution for clarity (at least 800px width for screenshots)
