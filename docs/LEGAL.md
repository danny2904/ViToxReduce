# Responsible Use Checklist

## ⚠️ Important Notice

ViToxReduce is a research tool designed to assist with toxicity reduction in Vietnamese text. This system should be used responsibly and ethically. Users are responsible for understanding the limitations and potential risks associated with automated text modification.

## ✅ Responsible Use Checklist

Before using ViToxReduce, please ensure you have reviewed and comply with the following guidelines:

### 1. Understanding System Limitations

- [ ] **I understand that automated toxicity detection is not perfect** and may produce false positives (classifying safe text as toxic) or false negatives (missing toxic content)
- [ ] **I recognize that text rewriting may alter meaning** or nuance, and outputs should be reviewed by humans before use
- [ ] **I acknowledge that the system is trained on specific datasets** and may not generalize perfectly to all domains, dialects, or contexts
- [ ] **I am aware that the system focuses on Vietnamese text** and may not work effectively for other languages

### 2. Appropriate Use Cases

- [ ] **I will use ViToxReduce for legitimate purposes** such as:
  - Moderation assistance for user-generated content
  - Content pre-processing before publication
  - Research and development of safer communication tools
  - Educational purposes to understand toxicity reduction techniques
- [ ] **I will NOT use ViToxReduce for**:
  - Censorship or suppression of legitimate speech
  - Automated content filtering without human oversight
  - Manipulation or alteration of text without consent
  - Any illegal activities or violation of terms of service

### 3. Privacy and Data Protection

- [ ] **I understand that text processed by ViToxReduce may contain sensitive information** and will handle it accordingly
- [ ] **I have obtained necessary consent** from users whose text is being processed
- [ ] **I will comply with applicable privacy laws** (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) when processing personal data
- [ ] **I will implement appropriate security measures** to protect processed text from unauthorized access
- [ ] **I will not store or log sensitive text** without proper encryption and access controls

### 4. Human Oversight and Review

- [ ] **I will implement human review processes** before publishing or using rewritten text in critical applications
- [ ] **I will not rely solely on automated outputs** for high-stakes decisions (e.g., content removal, user bans)
- [ ] **I will establish quality control procedures** to verify the accuracy and appropriateness of rewritten text
- [ ] **I will provide mechanisms for users to appeal** automated modifications to their content

### 5. Bias and Fairness Considerations

- [ ] **I understand that AI models may encode biases** from training data, which could affect certain groups or viewpoints disproportionately
- [ ] **I will monitor outputs for potential bias** and adjust usage accordingly
- [ ] **I will not use the system in ways that discriminate** against protected groups or legitimate perspectives
- [ ] **I will consider cultural and contextual factors** when evaluating toxicity classifications

### 6. Transparency and Accountability

- [ ] **I will inform users** when their content is being processed by automated systems
- [ ] **I will maintain transparency** about the use of automated text modification tools
- [ ] **I will provide explanations** when possible about why content was modified
- [ ] **I will keep records** of system usage for audit and accountability purposes

### 7. Legal and Compliance

- [ ] **I will comply with all applicable laws and regulations** in my jurisdiction
- [ ] **I will respect intellectual property rights** and not use the system to modify copyrighted content without authorization
- [ ] **I will not use the system to violate terms of service** of platforms or services
- [ ] **I understand that I am solely responsible** for legal compliance in my use of this tool

### 8. Technical Considerations

- [ ] **I will validate system outputs** before deployment in production environments
- [ ] **I will implement error handling** for cases where the system fails or produces unexpected results
- [ ] **I will monitor system performance** and update models as needed
- [ ] **I will keep the system updated** with the latest versions to benefit from improvements and security patches

### 9. Ethical Use Principles

- [ ] **I will use the system to promote constructive communication** rather than suppress diverse viewpoints
- [ ] **I will respect freedom of expression** while working to reduce harmful content
- [ ] **I will consider the broader societal impact** of my use of automated content modification
- [ ] **I will engage with affected communities** to understand their needs and concerns

### 10. Research and Development Use

- [ ] **If using for research**, I will clearly state the limitations and potential biases in my publications
- [ ] **I will cite the ViToxReduce system appropriately** in any research outputs
- [ ] **I will not misrepresent the capabilities** or reliability of the system
- [ ] **I will share findings responsibly**, especially regarding system limitations or biases discovered

## 📋 Best Practices

### For Content Moderation Platforms

1. Use ViToxReduce as an **assistive tool**, not a replacement for human moderators
2. Implement **tiered review processes** combining automated and human evaluation
3. Provide **clear guidelines** to users about content policies and modification procedures
4. Establish **appeal mechanisms** for users who disagree with automated modifications
5. Regularly **audit system performance** and adjust thresholds as needed

### For Research Applications

1. Document your methodology and system limitations clearly
2. Consider using multiple evaluation metrics beyond automated scores
3. Conduct user studies to understand real-world impact
4. Report both successes and failures transparently
5. Engage with ethical review boards when necessary

### For Educational Use

1. Emphasize the limitations and challenges of automated toxicity reduction
2. Discuss the trade-offs between safety, meaning preservation, and freedom of expression
3. Encourage critical thinking about automated content modification
4. Explore ethical implications of AI-assisted moderation
